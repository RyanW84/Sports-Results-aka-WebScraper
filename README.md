# Sports Results & Event Scraper

A C# web scraping application that monitors and notifies users about:
- Basketball game results
- Halestorm concert dates and events

## Requirements
1. This is an application where you should read sports data from a website once a day and send it to a specific e-mail address.
2. You don't need any interaction with the program. It will be a service that runs automatically.
3. The data should be collected from the Basketball Reference Website in the resources area.
4. You should use the Agility Pack library for scraping.
